# ScratchStart Theme

A bare-bones, minimal WordPress theme for developers who want a clean and simple starting point.

## Description

The ScratchStart Theme is a minimal WordPress theme designed for developers. It contains the essential files and structure you need to start building a custom WordPress theme, with no additional styling or optionsâ€”just the clean, raw basics.

## Features

- Minimalistic: No design, no colors, no frills
- Essential Templates: Contains just the core template files
- Clean Code: Readable, well-commented, developer-friendly code

## Installation

1. Download the theme as zip file or clone the repository.
2. Extract the zip file and copy the folder to your `wp-content/themes` directory.
3. In your WordPress admin, go to 'Appearance' > 'Themes' and click on 'Activate'.

## Usage

After activation, the theme is ready for development. Customize the PHP template files, add your own CSS to `style.css`. Do whatever you want!

## Developer Notes

This theme is intended as a starting point for your own theme development. It is deliberately bare and minimal to avoid the need to undo any unwanted styles or functions before you start your work. You can replace the string `scratchstart` with your own theme name in the whole theme.
